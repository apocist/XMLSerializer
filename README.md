# XMLSerializer

The purpose of this serializer is to work in much the same way xml serializers work (in result as string but not implementation) in other languages. The serializer is instantiated and with the Convert_Object and Convert_Array methods return an XML string constructed to work iteratively through an object or array regardless of the types it contains and its length.
